                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: white; font-size:larger">My name is Kevin Chau and I’m a student currently studying Computer Science and Cybersecurity at the University of Delaware. Whether it's programming, game dev, or web design — if it requires a computer and some creative thinking I’m interested!</p>
                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: white; font-size:larger">I have a deep passion for programming and I like solving problems. 
                        I first started learning Python in my first semester of college. Today I’m studying web development and cybersecurity, which allows me to think about the integrated approach to the conception and development of 
                        secure software design. </p>
                    
                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: white; font-size:larger">At the University of Delaware, I am taking or have taken a number of
                        higher-level computer science courses ranging from a variety of fields including Data Structures, Algorithms, Software Engineering, Automata Theory, and Machine Organization.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: white; font-size:larger">Aside from school, some of my hobbies include playing basketball, weightlifting, 
                        and playing video games. I also play VALORANT for the University of Delaware.</p>

        <h1 class="popup-header" style="color:rgb(72, 200, 72)">Python</h1>
        <div class="popup-description">Python... my first ever programming language. I learned the basics of this language
            through my first ever Computer Science course at the University of Delaware. Most recently
             I took a course on Algorithms where we used the simple syntax of Python to solve complex algorithmic problems.
             My plan forward with Python is to eventually learn Pandas, Numpy, Tkinter, and Matplotlib.

        <div class="button-row"><div class="exit-button" onclick="toggle('java')">x</div></div>
        <h1 class="popup-header" style="color: orange;">Java</h1>
        <div class="popup-description">Java is the programming language I learned immediately after Python. I learned the basics of
            this language through another introductory Computer Science course at the University of Delaware. Through this course,
            I learned the fundamentals and foundations of object-oriented-programming; a rather helpful skillset. While Java is a nice language to know,
            my experience with it has been rather... interesting. Basically, I'm not a fan of the lengthy syntax!

        <h1 class="popup-header" style="color:rgb(46, 46, 238)">C</h1>
        <div class="popup-description">I learned C through a Systems Programming course here at my university. This was my first ever
            experience with a low-level language and through the Systems Programming course I took, I was able to understand the importance
            of low-level programming, as it makes you think more logically. During the Spring 2024 semester, 
            I will be garnering more experience with C in a Parallel Programming course as well as an Operating Systems course.

        <div class="button-row"><div class="exit-button" onclick="toggle('cpp')">x</div></div>
        <h1 class="popup-header" style="color: purple;">C++</h1>
        <div class="popup-description">This was a language that I picked up in the fall of 2022 for a Data Structures course. C++ taught me the concept and importance of dynamic memory allocation, considering
            it is a "fast" language and memory management is important. I've not
            used C++ much since then unfortunately. However, I do plan on learning game development in the near future so I'm sure that
        C++ will come in handy!  </div>

        <div class="button-row"><div class="exit-button" onclick="toggle('html')">x</div></div>
        <h1 class="popup-header" style="color: orangered">HTML</h1>
        <div class="popup-description">Prior to making this website, I had limited experience with HTML, mainly because
            my university's curriculum focused on functional programming topics as opposed to application development. So here I am now,
            learning HTML so that I can make more web applications!

        <div class="popup-description">Like HTML, I have limited knowledge of CSS due to my lack of experience in web development.
            Although I am not the most creative or artistic person, I do enjoy using CSS primarily due to its effectiveness in making things look
        elegant! I aim to continue learning more styling elements! Eventually I aim to pick up Tailwind CSS. </div>

        <h1 class="popup-header" style="color: yellow;">JavaScript</h1>
        <div class="popup-description">As I continue to learn web development, I began to learn JavaScript to complement 
            both HTML and CSS so that I am able to build web applications. Currently I am focused on learning the front-end
        side with JavaScript but eventually I will learn how to manipulate the backend through Node.js and Express.js! Another goal of mine 
    is to learn React and Next.js! </div>
